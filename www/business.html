							<h1>Why Cumbria is the ideal location to do business, live, visit and <em>business</em></h1>
							<p>Home to world-leaders in energy, tourism, food and drink, specialist manufacturing and logistics, the commercial landscape in Cumbria is as magnificent as the natural assets for which it is famed across the globe. Most people know Cumbria for the Lake District and while tourism remains a key sector, the County boasts much more than just a superb place to visit.</p>
							<p>Cumbria business mix is diverse and is one of the least expensive areas in Britain to do business, with an affordable, skilled and loyal workforce and low overheads. There is a large portfolio of business parks available and a range of sites ripe for development - whether business, commercial or residential. Improvements have been made to training and education provision in the County over recent years, with providers helping support key sectors.</p>

									<h2>Business <em>Diversity &amp; Affordability</em> in Cumbria</h2>
									<p>From energy, specialist manufacturing and construction to tourism, logistics and the digital and creative sector - Cumbria boasts one of the most diverse businesses mixes in Britain.</p>
									<p>In West Cumbria and Furness the Britain's Energy Coast initiative is seeking to transform an economy so long reliant on traditional industry into a nationally important hub for low carbon and renewable energy generation and expertise. Barrow is at the core of the UK's submarine building prowess, while Carlisle is the County's key commercial centre and home to flagship companies including Stobart Group and Pirelli. Tourism, along with agriculture, is firmly at the heart of the Lake District economy, generating more than &pound;1bn into the County's economy each year.</p>
									<p>Surprisingly Cumbria is of the least expensive areas in the country to do business, with affordable labour and low overheads. The county has plenty of low cost sites on more than 30 industrial estates and business parks. The ready availability and cost effectiveness of sites in many parts of Cumbria, compared with other areas of the UK, provides a strong competitive advantage for investors. Operating costs are also amongst the lowest in the European Union.</p>

									<h2>The Cumbrian <em>Workforce</em></h2>
									<p>Birthplace of the world's civil nuclear industry, home to the first ever large-scale steel works, and the place where modern tourism was developed - a pioneering spirit and willingness to embrace and advance new ideas is woven into the fabric of Cumbria's entrepreneurs and workforce.</p>
									<p>In fact, Cumbria's people are one of the area's most valuable assets, with a first class reputation for productivity, low absenteeism and low staff turnover. People who live in Cumbria want to stay to enjoy an excellent quality of life and an opportunity to work in a wide and diverse range of industry sectors. Evidence suggests these are the reasons why young Cumbrians are returning and why young professionals are being drawn to the County. In turn businesses continue to demonstrate a commitment to their loyal employees, by providing training and education support.</p>
									<p>The Cumbrian workforce is also remarkably resilient, in the way it has adapted to the 25-year shift from heavy industry to new technologies and also the spirit and determination shown in remaining open for business during the 2009 floods and the 1991 Foot &amp; Mouth Disease outbreak. So many factors combine to make Cumbria's workforce one of the strongest in Britain. Around 60 per cent of Cumbria's 496,000 population are of working age.</p>
