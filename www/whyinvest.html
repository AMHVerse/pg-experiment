							<h1>Why invest in Cumbria</h1>
							<p><strong>Cumbria is the most beautiful and unique county in England; there is no better place to live, work, visit and invest.</strong></p>
							<p>Home to The Lake District, flanked by the Pennines and mile-upon-mile of stunning coastline, nowhere else in England boasts such a rich variety of inspirational and exhilarating landscapes.</p>
							<p class="center"><img src="images/lake-view.jpg" alt="" class="photo" /></p>
							<p>Cumbria possesses the brains to match its outstanding natural beauty and has proudly positioned itself as a world-leader in the maritime, specialist manufacturing and nuclear industries, while making significant strides into new sectors, in particular renewable energy.</p>
							<p>Connected by road (M6), rail (the West Coast Mainline and Cumbria Coast Line) and air (Carlisle Airport), England's second largest county is in a perfect location to reach national and international markets. This, along with a wide range of rural and urban opportunities and an unrivalled quality of life, combine to create the perfect place to mix business and pleasure.</p>
