							<h1>Why Cumbria is the ideal location to do business, live, visit and <em>invest</em></h1>
							<p>Cumbria is the most beautiful and unique county in England; there is no better place to live, work, visit and invest.</p>
							<p>Home to The Lake District, flanked by the Pennines and mile-upon-mile of stunning coastline, nowhere else in England boasts such a rich variety of inspirational and exhilarating landscapes.</p>

									<h2>Nearest cities to Cumbria</h2>
									<p>The M6 runs through Cumbria and along with major trunk roads make the north, north-east, and Scotland within a comfortable drive.</p>
									<p>Major east to west routes give easy access to the east coast ports and to Europe.</p>
									<p>London can be reached by the M6 and M1 motorways or by rail with direct trains from Carlisle, Penrith and Oxenholme (Kendal).</p>
									<h3>Carlisle</h3><p>Carlisle is located at the confluence of the rivers Eden, Caldew and Petteril, 10 miles (16 km) south of the Scottish border. It is the largest settlement in the county of Cumbria, and serves as the administrative centre for both Carlisle City Council and Cumbria County Council. At the time of the 2001 census, the population of Carlisle was 71,773, with 100,734 living in the wider city.</p>
									<h3>Edinburgh</h3>
									<p>Located in the south-east of Scotland, Edinburgh lies on the east coast of the Central Belt, along the Firth of Forth, near the North Sea. Owing to its spectacular, rugged setting and vast collection of Medieval and Georgian architecture, including numerous stone tenements, it is often considered one of the most picturesque cities in Europe.</p>
									<h3>Glasgow</h3><p>Glasgow is the largest city in Scotland and third most populous in the United Kingdom. The city is situated on the River Clyde in the country's west central lowlands.</p>
									<h3>Newcastle </h3><p>Newcastle is a city and metropolitan borough of Tyne and Wear, in North East England. Situated on the north bank of the River Tyne, the city developed in the area that was the location of the Roman settlement called Pons Aelius, though it owes its name to the castle built in 1080. The city grew as an important centre for the wool trade and it later became a major coal mining area. The port developed in the 16th century and, along with the shipyards lower down the river, was amongst the world's largest shipbuilding and ship-repairing centres.</p>
									<h3>Lancaster </h3><p>Long existing as a commercial, cultural and educational centre, Lancaster is the settlement that gives Lancashire its name. Lancaster has several unique ties to the British monarchy; the House of Lancaster was a branch of the English royal family, whilst the Duchy of Lancaster holds large estates on behalf of Queen Elizabeth, who herself is also the Duke of Lancaster. Lancaster was granted city status in 1937 for its "long association with the crown" and because it was "the county town of the King's Duchy of Lancaster".</p>
									<h3>Preston</h3><p>Preston is the administrative centre of Lancashire, England, located on the north bank of the River Ribble. It is an urban settlement and unparished area that, when combined with its surrounding suburban and rural hinterland, forms part of the City of Preston local government district of Lancashire, which obtained city status in 2002, becoming England's 50th city in the 50th year of Queen Elizabeth II's reign. The settlement, or unparished area, of Preston has a population of 114,300, and the whole City of Preston district has a population of 132,000</p>
									<h3>Leeds</h3><p>Historically a part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, Leeds can trace its recorded history to fifth century when the Kingdom of Elmet was covered by the forest of "Loidis", the origin of the name Leeds. In the 17th and 18th centuries Leeds became a major centre for the production and trading of wool. Then, during the Industrial Revolution, Leeds developed into a major industrial centre; wool was still the dominant industry but flax, engineering, iron foundries, printing and other industries were important.</p>
									<h3>Manchester</h3><p>Manchester is situated in the south-central part of North West England, fringed by the Cheshire Plain to the south and the Pennines to the north and east. The recorded history of Manchester began with the civilian vicus associated with the Roman fort of Mamucium, which was established 79AD on a sandstone bluff near the confluence of the rivers Medlock and Irwell. Historically, most of the city was a part of Lancashire, although areas south of the River Mersey were in Cheshire.</p>
									<h3>Liverpool</h3><p>Historically a part of Lancashire, the urbanisation and expansion of Liverpool were both largely brought about by the city's status as a major port. By the 18th century, trade from the West Indies, Ireland and mainland Europe coupled with close links with the Atlantic Slave Trade furthered the economic expansion of Liverpool. By the early 19th century, 40% of the world's trade passed through Liverpool's docks, contributing to Liverpool's rise as a major city.</p>

									<h2><em>Rail Hubs/Links</em> in and around Cumbria</h2>
									<p>Cumbria has enjoyed a remarkably diverse railway history. Starting with locally promoted lines such as those from Carlisle to Newcastle and Maryport in the 1830s and 40s, these were soon linked into the first of the great trunk lines through the area, the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway and its northern partner, the Caledonian Railway.</p>
									<p>Local lines proliferated round the coast serving the burgeoning coal and iron industries of West Cumberland and Furness, with the Furness Railway eventually dominating the scene in the south and west - and performing a vital role in the development of its home town, Barrow-in-Furness. Across the county ran the links from the Durham coal fields to West Cumberland and along the Pennines came the Settle &amp; Carlisle line of the Midland Railway.</p>
									<h2>Carlisle </h2><p>Carlisle railway station, also known as Carlisle Citadel station, is a railway station which serves the Cumbrian City of Carlisle, and is a major station on the West Coast Main Line, lying 102 miles (164 km) south of Glasgow Central, and 299 miles (481 km) north of London Euston. It is also the northern terminus of the celebrated Settle and Carlisle Line - notionally (and historically) a continuation of the Midland Main Line from Leeds, Sheffield and ultimately London St Pancras. It is a Grade II* listed building. Carlisle Railway station was used for the Homebase advert in 2010.</p> 
									<h3>Penrith </h3><p>Penrith railway station is located on the West Coast Main Line in the United Kingdom. It serves the town of Penrith, Cumbria and is less than one mile from its centre. National Express coaches leave from the station's car park and there are bus links to Keswick, Workington. Appleby-in-Westmorland and Ullswater from here too.</p> 
									<h3>Oxenholme The Lake District </h3><p>The station is situated on the West Coast Main Line and is also the start of the Windermere Branch Line to Windermere. The station serves as a main line connection point for Kendal, and is managed by Virgin Trains. The word "the" is sometimes omitted from the station name.</p>
									<p>Oxenholme has the distinction of being the only village station currently served by express trains on the West Coast Main Line, all the other stations on this route serving either towns or cities.</p>
									<h3>Kendal </h3><p>The station is situated on the Windermere Branch Line from Oxenholme to Windermere. It is operated by First TransPennine Express. It only has one platform which has a stone-built shelter. It is unstaffed. It is served by one train per hour in each direction with some trains running direct to Manchester. Passengers for most other destinations must change at Oxenholme.</p> 
									<h3>Burneside</h3><p>The station is situated on the Windermere Branch Line from Oxenholme to Windermere. Burneside is a request stop. It only has one platform, although before the branch was reduced to single track it, like the other stations on the line, had two.</p> 
									<h3>Staveley </h3><p>The station is situated on the Windermere Branch Line from Oxenholme to Windermere. Staveley is a request stop.</p> 
									<h3>Windermere </h3><p>It is located just south of the A591, about fifteen minutes' walk or a short bus ride from the lake.It is the terminus of the former Kendal and Windermere Railway single-track Windermere Branch Line, with a single platform serving one terminal track.</p>
									<p>The station was at one time bigger than this, with four platforms and an overall roof. Three tracks were taken out of use when the branch was reduced to a one-train operated single line in 1973 as an economy measure.</p>
									<h3>Lazonby and Kirkoswald </h3><p>This station serves the villages of Lazonby and Kirkoswald in Cumbria, England. It is operated by Northern Rail who provide all passenger train services. It is situated in the centre of Lazonby and, like many other stations on the line, was closed on 4 May 1970 when local passenger services between Skipton &amp; Carlisle were withdrawn. The platforms and buildings survived however, and following several years of use by Dalesrail excursions it was reopened on a full-time basis in July 1986.</p> 
									<h3>Langwathby </h3><p>Langwathby railway station is a railway station which serves the village of Langwathby. It is operated by Northern Rail who provide all passenger train services. The station was built by the Midland Railway and opened in 1876. It closed when local stopping trains over the Settle-Carlisle Line were withdrawn in May 1970, but was reopened in July 1986.</p> 
									<h3>Appleby </h3><p>Opened by the Midland Railway at the same time as the line itself in May 1876, it became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The station then passed to the London Midland Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. It was one of only two stations on the Settle-Carlisle line to remain open (Settle being the other) following the withdrawal of local stopping trains in May 1970.</p><p>When Sectorisation was introduced in the 1980s, the station was served by Regional Railways until the Privatisation of British Railways.</p>
									<h3>Kirkby Stephen</h3><p>The station is situated nearly a mile from the town at Midland Hill and was formerly known as Kirkby Stephen West because of the older Kirkby Stephen or Kirkby Stephen East station that was situated in the town and was on the North Eastern Railway's Stainmore and Eden Valley lines.</p>
									<p>The station is served by seven trains to Carlisle each weekday and six trains to Leeds. Saturdays see an extra service towards Leeds, whilst there are three trains each way on Sundays. DalesRail services between Blackpool North/Preston and Carlisle also call at the station on Sundays during the summer.</p>
									<h3>Garsdale </h3><p>Adjoining the station are sixteen Railway Cottages built for its employees by the Midland Railway around 1876, the year the Settle-Carlisle Line opened. A further six cottages were added near to the Moorcock Inn soon afterwards. The station once boasted the highest water troughs in the world (just along the line at Ling Gill), and a waiting room where Anglican church services were held. Also Garsdale, in steam days, had a turntable with a wall of sleepers around it to prevent locomotives being spun by strong winds.</p> 
									<h3>Dent </h3><p>Dent railway station serves the villages of Cowgill and Dent in Cumbria, England. It is operated by Northern Rail who provide all passenger train services.</p>
									<p>Dent village is approximately four miles to the west, and 400 ft (122 m) below the height of the station, with Cowgill being the nearest village, around half a mile away.</p>
									<p>At an altitude of 1,150 feet (351 metres) near Blea Moor Tunnel, Dent is the highest railway station on the National Rail network in England. Dent Station buildings are available to rent as holiday cottage accommodation</p>
									<h3>Ribblehead </h3><p>This station is now leased by the Settle and Carlisle Railway Trust who have completely restored and refurbished it. There are resident caretakers, a small shop selling memorabilia, and its Visitor Centre includes exhibits about the history of the line and the fight to keep it open. One exhibit in the Visitor Centre is the original station sign and a small exhibition about the Midland Railway company, builders of the line and originally the train operators.</p> 
									<h3>Horton-in-Ribblesdale </h3><p>In the 1950s and 60s under stationmaster Taylor, Horton won the Best Kept Station award for seventeen consecutive years. The station lost its passenger service on 4 May 1970, but reopened in July 1986, along with several other local stations on the line.</p> 
									<h3>Settle </h3><p>The station dates from May 1876 and is staffed on a part-time basis. There are a range of facilities available in the main buildings on the southbound platform.</p>
									<p>The old station signal box &ndash; which was abolished in 1984 &ndash; has been restored as a visitor attraction by the Friends of the Settle - Carlisle Line - it is located behind the southbound platform and is open to the public at certain times.</p>
									<h3>Wetheral </h3><p>The 1830's brought the railway age to Wetheral. The renowned Wetheral Railway Viaduct carries the Carlisle to Newcastle railway over the River Eden. It was constructed by Francis Giles between 1830 and 1834, and stands 100 feet high. It was one of the first railway viaducts to be built in this country. A footpath goes across the railway viaduct between Wetheral station and Great Corby.</p> 
									<h3>Brampton </h3><p>The station is located about a mile south east of the town, near the village of Milton. Staff were removed from the station in 1967, with the main buildings demolished in stages during the 1970's. In former times a short branch line, known locally as 'The Dandy', ran from the station, then known as Brampton Junction, to Brampton Town railway station in the centre of of Brampton. This line closed in 1923 and most of the route is now a public footpath.</p> 
									<h3>Dalston </h3><p>The railway station is a request stop on part of the scenic Cumbrian Coast Line 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) south west of Carlisle</p> 
									<h3>Wigton </h3><p>The railway station is a stop on the scenic Cumbrian Coast Line 18 kilometres (11 mi) south east of Carlisle.</p> 
									<h3>Aspatria </h3><p>Opened by the Maryport and Carlisle Railway  in 1841, the station was once the junction for a long-defunct branch line to Mealsgate. Passenger trains on this route began in 1866 but ceased in September 1930 and complete closure followed in 1952.</p>
									<p>The station became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway during the Grouping of 1923, and then passed on to the London Midland Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948.</p>
									<h3>Maryport </h3><p>The station is somewhat unusual in that it consists of a single bi-directional platform rather than the usual two side platforms used elsewhere on the double track sections of the Cumbrian Coast line. Southbound trains have to cross over to the northbound line to reach the platform before returning to the correct line south of the station. This can cause delays if two trains are scheduled to call in quick succession or if one or more trains are running late.</p> 
									<h3>Flimby </h3><p>The railway station is a request stop on the scenic Cumbrian Coast Line 47 kilometres (29 mi) south east of Carlisle railway station.</p>
									<p>There is generally an hourly service northbound to Carlisle and southbound to Whitehaven railway station with some trains going onwards to Barrow-in-Furness railway station. On Sundays three trains a day go Carlisle and Whitehaven. All of these trains only stop at Flimby on request.</p>
									<h3>Workington </h3><p>The present station is the second one to occupy the site. The first one was built at the opening of the original line and replaced by the London &amp; North Western Railway who took over the Whitehaven Junction and Workington &amp; Cockermouth lines in 1866. The Workington station in its present form was first known as Workington LNWR then at the grouping it was renamed Workington Main. With the end of steam the station then was referred to as 'Workington' railway station.</p> 
									<h3>Harrington </h3><p>The railway station is a request stop on the scenic Cumbrian Coast Line 56 kilometres (35 mi) south east of Carlisle.</p> 
									<h3>Parton </h3><p>The railway station is a stop on the scenic Cumbrian Coast Line 61 kilometres (38 mi) south east of Carlisle. Immediately north and south of Parton, the line runs almost on the seashore, at the foot of cliffs which require supervision and occasional stabilisation to prevent landslides; sea erosion is also a danger, and 10MPH speed restrictions are in force over much of the section between here and Harrington, which is restricted to a single line. There is a signal box immediately to the north of the station.</p> 
									<h3>Whitehaven </h3><p>The station formerly had four operational platforms, but today only two remain in use. The double line from Parton becomes single opposite the station signal box (which still bears the original station name Whitehaven Bransty) and then splits into two. Trains heading south must collect a token for the single line section to St Bees from a machine on the platform (with permission from the signaller) before they can proceed. Conversely trains from Barrow must surrender the token upon arrival, the driver returning it to the machine before departing for Workington. Only then can the signaller allow another train to enter the single line section.</p> 
									<h3>St Bees </h3><p>The railway station is a stop on part of the scenic Cumbrian Coast Line 70 kilometres (43 mi) south-west of Carlisle. It is the location of the only passing loop on the otherwise single track section between Whitehaven and Sellafield and trains are sometimes scheduled to pass here. The station still has a signal box, and there is a car park adjacent in the old goods yard. The station is situated only 200 yards from the centre of the village, and there are three pubs within easy walking distance; one, the Albert, formerly being noted for having warning of the approaching trains rung through from the signal box in the evening.</p> 
									<h3>Sellafield </h3><p>The serves the nuclear facility of Sellafield in Cumbria, England. The railway station is a stop on the scenic Cumbrian Coast Line. Some through trains to the Furness Line stop here.</p>
									<p>The station (which dates from 1850) is a busy freight location, as much of the nuclear waste for Sellafield's Thorp nuclear fuel reprocessing plant is carried by train here from the docks in Barrow-in-Furness or from rail-connected nuclear power stations elsewhere in the UK.</p>
									<h3>Seascale </h3><p>The railway is dual-track as it passes through Seascale. The railway at Seascale passes over three bridges (two paths; one road) and underneath one (footbridge). The views are of St Bees Head and Scotland (to the north), Seascale village (to the east and south) and the Isle of Man (to the west). There are train shelters and seating but this is not a staffed station. Freight trains often pass through either going to or coming from Sellafield.</p> 
									<h3>Drigg </h3><p>The railway station is a request stop on the scenic Cumbrian Coast Line 24 kilometres (15 mi) south of Whitehaven. Some through trains to the Furness Line stop here.</p> 
									<h3>Ravenglass </h3><p>This station has two platforms, one serving trains travelling towards Barrow-in-Furness and one for trains travelling towards Carlisle. All former station buildings on the National Rail site, which is now unstaffed, are currently owned by the Eskdale Railway company, the main building being a pub, The Ratty Arms, the old southbound shelter a museum (leaving only small shelters for mainline travellers) and the goods shed an engineering workshop. Through tickets from trains on the Cumbria Coast Line are available to the Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway.</p> 
									<h3>Bootle </h3><p>Bootle Station serves the village of Bootle and the neighbouring hamlet of Hycemoor in Cumbria, England. The railway station is a request stop on the scenic Cumbrian Coast Line 39 kilometres (24 mi) north of Barrow-in-Furness. It is operated by Northern Rail who provide all passenger train services.</p> 
									<h3>Silecroft </h3><p>The railway station is a request stop on the scenic Cumbrian Coast Line 31 kilometres (19 mi) north east of Barrow-in-Furness. Some through trains to the Furness Line stop here.</p> 
									<h3>Millom </h3><p>The railway station is a stop on the scenic Cumbrian Coast Line 26 kilometres (16 mi) north of Barrow-in-Furness.</p>
									<p>It was opened by the Whitehaven &amp; Furness Junction Railway in 1850.</p>
									<p>The station buildings also house Millom Folk Museum and a small workshop offering furniture restoration.</p>
									<h3>Green Road</h3><p>Green Road railway station serves The Green, in Cumbria, England, a village some 3 miles (5 km) north of Millom and the rural parish of Millom Without. The railway station is a request stop on the scenic Cumbrian Coast Line north of Barrow-in-Furness.</p>
									<p>Green Road has been adopted since 1981 and is a member of Northern Rail's Station Adoption scheme. The station has won a number of awards for its gardens.</p>
									<h3>Foxfield </h3><p>The station dates from 1848, when the Furness Railway extended its line from Barrow to Kirkby-in-Furness to nearby Broughton-in-Furness with the intention of serving local copper mines. It was opened on 1 August 1848 and consisted of an island platform 13 feet 6 inches (4.11 m) long. Its west face was enclosed in a passenger shed 100 feet (30 m) long. There was also a goods shed 70 feet (21 m) long, and a very small booking office at the north end of the platform.</p> 
									<h3>Kirkby-in-Furness</h3><p>The name Kirkby-in-Furness did not exist until the creation of the railway line. The village in fact is an amalgamation of six smaller villages/hamlets. The name Kirkby was chosen almost at random by the train company for the station and was eventually used for the collection of villages. In Victorian times it gained some fame as the station with the longest platform seat in the country. This though was removed many years ago.</p> 
									<h3>Askam-in-Furness </h3><p>The railway along the Cumbrian coast was completed over many years by numerous small firms, who often would refuse to work together. However, eventually 'Grouping' forced the companies to work together on the railway, instead of constantly competing. Further problems were encountered when the people building the railway ran out of money, and so the proposed Duddon Viaduct, from Askam to Millom, was abandoned. Instead, a different route, going by way of Foxfield, was planned. This saved &pound;37,000.</p>
									<h3>Barrow-in-Furness </h3><p>The present station was formerly known as Barrow Central and at one time it was a terminus for British Rail long-distance or InterCity services. From October 1947 until May 1983 these included sleeper services to and from London Euston. A sleeper service in the London direction only was briefly reintroduced between May 1987-May 1990.</p> 
									<h3>Roose </h3><p>Generally, only local services operated by Northern Rail stop at the station. However, a few longer-distances services operated by First TransPennine Express also use the station.</p> 
									<h3>Dalton </h3><p>Generally, only local services operated by Northern Rail stop at the station. However, a few longer-distances services operated by First TransPennine Express also use the station.</p> 
									<h3>Ulverston </h3><p>It is primarily served by regional express services operated by TransPennine Express from Manchester Airport to Barrow-in-Furness. Additionally it is served by local services operated by Northern Rail from Lancaster to Barrow-in-Furness, with some continuing to Sellafield or Carlisle via the Cumbrian Coast Line. The current buildings are architecturally fine and date from 1873, when they were rebuilt as befitting one of the main stations of the Furness Railway. The clock tower and glass awnings, now extensively restored, are particularly fine.</p> 
									<h3>Cark and Cartmel </h3><p>The station is architecturally interesting, with a main building (see image) erected by the Ulverston and Lancaster Railway in 1857. The station had a particular importance, as it serves Holker Hall, the home of Lord Cavendish of Furness formerly belonging to the Dukes of Devonshire. Special waiting rooms were provided for the dukes and their guests. The actual building retains many original features and is now a private residence. It extends to approximately one acre of gardens and woodland.</p> 
									<h3>Kents Bank</h3><p>The station building was designed by the Lancaster architects Paley and Austin in 1865 for the Furness Railway.</p>
									<p>Generally, services that are operated by Northern Rail mainly stop at this station. However, a few longer-distances services operated by First TransPennine Express also use the station.</p>
									<h3>Grange-over-Sands </h3><p>The station is adjacent to the Grange-Over-Sands Promenade which (until the River Kent changed its course) ran along the edge of Morecambe Bay.</p>
									<p>The station booking office is on the "up" (Lancaster) platform; the "down" Barrow) platform features a second-hand book-shop. There is step-less access to both platforms.</p>
									<h3>Arnside </h3><p>Opened in 1858 by the Ulverston and Lancaster Railway (a company backed by, and later taken over by the Furness Railway) (FR) in 1857, the station became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The station then passed on to the London Midland Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948.</p> 
									<h3>Silverdale </h3><p>Generally, only local services operated by Northern Rail stop at the station. However, a few longer-distances services operated by First TransPennine Express also use the station.</p> 
									<h3>Carnforth </h3><p>Carnforth station was opened in 1846 by the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway Company (LCRC). It originally had a single platform and was a second-class station. It became a junction in 1857 when it was adjoined to the Ulverston and Lancaster Railway as its terminus. Soon afterwards, the Furness Railway began operating to Carnforth.</p>

									<p>Smaller ports can be found at Maryport and Whitehaven, focused mainly on serving the fishing and leisure and tourism sectors, while the Port of Millom is currently advancing plans to extend the services it provides to the business, leisure, tourism, energy and environment sectors.</p>
									<h3>Port of Heysham </h3><p>Heysham Port is the 24 HOUR gateway offering easy round-the-clock access for Irish Sea ferries, a diverse range of general cargo services and the response-time sensitive offshore gas supply industry.</p> </h3><h3>Port of Barrow </h3><p>Centrally located on the West Coast of the UK, Barrow has worldwide trading links. The port has considerable experience in handling specialist cargoes as well as a range of bulk aggregates. It is also an ideal base for offshore and renewable-energy projects located in the Irish Sea, and has become the import hub for Kimberly Clark's woodpulp products.</p>
									<p>Barrow is known as the 'Gateway to the Lake District', and is a welcoming port of call for 'round-Britain' cruises.</p></h3><h3>Whitehaven Marina </h3><p>Whitehaven Marina is the most comprehensive marina on the north west coast of England; a safe harbour with 285 fully serviced marina berths and extensive quay wall berth areas for larger boats.</p>
									<p>Access to the marina is available at almost all states of the tide and the boatyard services include boat lifting, hard standing and under cover boat storage.</p></h3><h3>Port of Workington </h3><p>The Port of Workington is the largest port in Cumbria and one of the main hubs in the North West. It serves the region's industry and agriculture, including most of the major manufacturing and processing businesses in the area.</p>
									<p>Workington handles 600,000 tonnes of cargo and around 300 ship movements each year. The port has room for expansion and has been diversifying into new operations since the emergence of the Britain's Energy Coast initiative. It recently secured &pound;5.7m to establish a major container handling facility, which will significantly improve links to international markets.</p></h3><h3>Maryport Harbour </h3><p>Maryport harbour was developed around a fishing creek at the mouth of the River Ellen in the nineteenth century. The harbour prospered mainly due to the export of coal to Ireland, and exports of steel rails, bar bolts and cast iron from the Solway Iron Works. Shipbuilders' yards were also a common sight around Maryport. In recent years the business of the port has focused on serving the local fishing industry and on a growing leisure and tourism market, helped by significant investment to improve the marina.</p> </h3><h3>Port of Silloth </h3><p>The Port of Silloth has seen steady growth in tonnage levels over recent years. Located on the English side of the Solway Firth, many of the port's customers trade with Western Europe. Silloth's principal trade is agribulks and the port is the North-West base for the operations of Prime Molasses - a major UK supplier of molasses to the animal-feed industry.</p>
									<p>The port plays an integral role in the Cumbrian and regional economy and is a catalyst for local trade and commerce.</p></h3><h3>Port of Millom </h3><p>On the fringe of the Lake District National Park, Port Millom offers a direct gateway to the stunning western and southern lakes and fells, as well as the Irish Sea coast and the Isle of Man.</p>
									<p>Privately-owned and in operation for many years, the port currently focuses on serving the transport, storage, tourism and energy sectors. It also provides a number of marine services to commerce and industry in the Northwest of England.</p>
