							<h1>How we help</h1>
							<p><strong>Invest in Cumbria is the lead organisation for domestic and international inward investment activity in one of Britain's most vibrant and diverse business locations.</strong></p>
							<p>We are responsible for marketing Cumbria as a premier investment "destination" to business across the world. Most people know Cumbria primarily for the Lake District, but we and many successful businesses who have made England's most beautiful corner their home, know that the commercial landscape is as magnificent as our natural assets.</p>
							<p>Invest in Cumbria backs up this inspirational sales pitch by offering free and confidential services to help companies looking to set up new divisions in the County and relocate from elsewhere. Our remit also covers large and strategically important businesses already operating in Cumbria because we believe that looking after our successful and high growth companies is just as important as encouraging more to locate here.</p>
							<p>Our mission is to be a first point of contact for businesses hooked on the idea of locating or growing in a place where international business, unspoilt beauty and an unrivalled quality of life combine to create a unique investment destination and the perfect place to mix business and pleasure.</p>
							<p>Cumbria is a vast County, the second largest in England, and there are many organisations ready to assist businesses. We provide expert knowledge built up over many years to ensure businesses from a wide spectrum of sectors gain a better understanding of where they can access the right support. This is why we work with an extensive network of support agencies, local authorities, education providers and business professionals to provide everything from project management services and advice on the best business sites and premises to guidance on investment packages and access to high quality training and recruitment support.</p>
							<p>Home to world-leaders in energy, tourism, food and drink, specialist manufacturing and logistics and much more we know there is much more to Cumbria than just looks; we are a place of brains as well as beauty. Now is the time to join Cumbria on its journey to a more prosperous future – a place where you can find Britain's Energy Coast just a few miles from the mountains and lakes that inspired some of the world's greatest writers.</p>
